Problem 4: Code Analysis & Debugging (15 points)
1. Encapsulation Violation

public static String companyName;	
Field is public, so any class can change it directly. It Should be private and accessed via getter/setter.
    correct version:
    private static String companyName ;
      public static String getCompanyName() {
        return companyName;
    }


Salary and employeeName attributes are private  but the class doesn’t provide getters, so you can’t read their values outside.
corrected version:
public String getEmployeeName() {
        return employeeName;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

2. Static misuse

companyName attribute is static - means it belongs to the class, not individual employees,so it should be initializad to avoid null values.
private static String companyName ="Company A";

3.Constructor Problems
Only sets name,there is no validation, salary is uninitialized.
It should set salary to 0.0 for clarity
 public EmployeeManagement(String name)throws InvalidEmployeeException{
        if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new InvalidProductException("Name can not be empty");
        }
        employeeName = name;
        this.salary = 0.0;
    }

4. Misuse of  return type
public void calculateBonus() {
    return salary * 0.1;
}

The method says void, which means it should not return anything.But it’s trying to return a value.

The correct method should be:

public double calculateBonus() {
    return salary * 0.1;
}

5. Missing exception handling

Instead of just printing "Salary cannot be negative", it should be handled by throwing an exception.

Example:

if (salary < 0) {
    throw new InvalidSalaryException("Salary cannot be negative");
}

6.Logic error
This line salary = salary doesn’t actually set anything,it’s setting the parameter salary to itself  not the class variable.

The correct one should be:  this.salary = salary;
